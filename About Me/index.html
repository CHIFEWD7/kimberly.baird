<h2>My name is Kim, Kimmy, Kimberly...</h2>

<p>Yes, I answer to all! I am a native Chicagoan that has been designing professionally for the last 7 years. My design career has given me a diverse background that includes social media strategy and design, print ads, mobile landing pages, and digital ad products. I love all forms of design and I don't like to limit myself in an industry that is constantly evolving and capitalizing on new innovations.</p>

<p>When I'm not living and breathing design, you can find me at the Chicago lakefront with my husband. When I have the chance, I love to travel and plan adventures that include exploring new cities, hiking, swimming, or downhill skiing.</p>
